You will see two folder and file.

-The front end folder contain only the design of mahmoud khairy. 

-The profile system folder is the folder which contain the whole project front end and the back end.

I do this becuase when i do my task the back end i faced  problems that the design go wrong after i writing the php code , i don't 
know why this happen , i tried differant methods to solve this problem , and now i think the problem may be in my browser
or in my editor so that i put the design in a folder and the project in another folder.
i hope you look at my code , i don't know until now where the problem.
thanks!
